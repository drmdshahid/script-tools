# Script-Tools
- collection of some scripts or tools that are handy and make work eaiser.
- Mostly written by me and some are inspired for others.

## InsertAllSlides.ppam

- This is Powerpoint Add-in (VBA macro/script)
- What it does?: insert all slides from all presentations in the same folder as the currently active presentation (but won't try to insert slides from the current presentation into itself).
- this the best and easiest way to **merge Microsoft Presentations**.

  - Solution 2 at [PPTools](https://www.rdpslides.com/pptfaq/FAQ00746_Insert_all_slides_from_a_group_of_presentations_into_the_current_presentation.htm)
  - [Office RibbonX editor](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor)
- Initialisation:
  - Turn on Developer tab: File > Options > Customize Ribbon > check [ ] Developer
  - Add the add-in: Developer Tab > Powerpoint Add-ins > Add New... & brouse for the above downloaded add-in.
  - This will create 'Insert slides from folder' ribbon button in Developer tab > 'Custom' group
- Usage: open a ppt to which you want to add the slides from all other ppts within the same folder. Click on the 'Insert slides from folder' button to import all the slides. _Hurray!_
